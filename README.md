# HLJ_soybean_map
A 30-m dataset that mapped the areas of soybean planting in Heilongjiang Province was produced, for the period of 1984~2020, based on Landsat-5/7/8 images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Maps were made with a random forest classifier and phenological features extracted by a double-logistic model and a linear harmonic model. Here share our codes about how to use GEE platform to generate soybean maps and to verify accuracy of the map with MATLAB code.
